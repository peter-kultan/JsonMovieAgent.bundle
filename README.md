JSON Metadata Agent for Plex
============================
Plex agent for Plex to load movie metadata from JSON located in folder with your media.

Media Structure
---------------
This agent supports only movies, agent for TV Shows is in development.

Movies Metadata should be presented in `Info.json` file in same directory as your movie(s). For Example:

```
Movies
   |- Movie Subdir
   |   |- Memento.mkv
   |   |- Fight Club.mkv
   |   |- Memento.jpg
   |   |- Fight Club.jpg
   |   \- Info.json
   |- Zombieland.mp4
   |- No Country for Old Men.mkv
   |- Zombieland.jpg
   |- No Country for Old Men.jpg
   \- Info.json
```

Example JSON
------------
The `Info.json` file is structured to follow Plex Movie Metadata Model as much as possible. It should look something like (this example is for `Movie subdir` mentioned above):

```json
